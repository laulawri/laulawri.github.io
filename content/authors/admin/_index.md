## About Me

I am currently a  Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, working with Professor Sarah Sebo in the Human Robot Interaction Lab.

I am interesting in exploring how social robots can be used in childhood education to create safe spaces for students. My current research investigates how to best use robots to teach social-emotional learning in ways that provide the most benefit to students and teachers alike.
